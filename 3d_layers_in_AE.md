# 3D Layers in After Effects 🎬

## Understanding 3D Layers
3D layers in After Effects work like a piece of paper in 3D space, having **X, Y, and Z axes**.

### Enabling 3D for a Layer
To make any layer (e.g., image, text) 3D:
- Click on the **3D icon (cube) in the layers panel**.

> This enables 3D transformation parameters for the selected layer.

### Editing 3D Objects
- Modify **3D parameters** in the **Orthogonal View** (2D perspective: front, back, top, bottom).
- Change views to **2-view mode**:
  - Set one to **Custom View** (used for previewing changes).

---

## Modifying 3D Parameters ✏️
- Adjust **X, Y, and Z directions** using:
  - **3D arrows in the preview screen**
  - **Timeline settings**
- **Important Note:** Ensure that your **Z-axis always extends out of the plane**, just like when creating the first 3D cube.

## Lights & Types of Lighting in 3D 💡

### Enabling Lights in After Effects
- Add light just like adding a **solid layer**.
- Modify its **color, intensity, and position**.
- After applying light, enable **Cast Shadow** from the **Material Options**.
  - **Shortcut:** Select the layer and press `AA` (double-click `A`).

### Types of Lights in After Effects
1️⃣ **Point Light** ✨  
   - Acts like a **light bulb** that illuminates everything around it.

2️⃣ **Spot Light** 🔦  
   - Applies light to a **specific area**.
   - Additional settings:
     - **Cone Angle** 🎯: Adjusts the spotlight coverage.
     - **Cone Feather** 📏: Controls the sharpness of the spotlight edges.

3️⃣ **Parallel Light** ☀️  
   - Simulates **sunlight**, with parallel rays and no specific point of origin.

4️⃣ **Ambient Light** 🌫️  
   - Simulates **indirect external light**, like room lighting when all lights are off but visibility remains.

## 3D Camera in After Effects 📷
### Adding a 3D Camera
- Insert a camera **just like adding a solid** in layers.
- Works like a **real camera**, allowing dynamic views of 3D objects.
- Multiple cameras can be added simultaneously.

### Camera Transform Properties
- **Point of Interest** 🎯: The point the camera is focusing on.
- **Position** 📍: Defines the overall position of the camera.

### Types of 3D Cameras
1️⃣ **One-Node Camera** 🎥  
2️⃣ **Two-Node Camera** 🎬

### Depth of Field in Cameras 🔍
- Enable **Depth of Field** in the camera settings (Timeline panel).
- Unlocks parameters like:
  - **Focus Length** 🔭
  - **Aperture** 🎚️ (Higher value = more blur in out-of-focus areas).

📝 **Summary**: This guide covers 3D layers, modifying 3D parameters, working with lights, and setting up cameras in **Adobe After Effects** for enhanced 3D motion graphics. 🚀
