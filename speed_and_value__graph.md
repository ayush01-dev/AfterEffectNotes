# ✨ After Effects Notes

## 🎯 Speed Graph in After Effects
📌 The **Speed Graph** provides greater control over easing in or easing out animations.
📈 The curve created after selecting **Ease Ease** is **parabolic**, representing the speed in **pixels per second**.

## 📊 Value Graph in After Effects
The **Value Graph** helps in adjusting the position of an object smoothly. You can use the **Separate Dimensions** feature to individually control **X and Y** movements.

### 🔹 Y Curve (🟢 Green Line)
✔️ You can add **keyframes** to it.
✔️ Example: Changing the **Y dimension** from `0 px` to `1920 px` in your composition.

### 🔸 X Curve (🔴 Red Line)
✔️ Works similarly for horizontal movement.

🚀 Using the **Value Graph**, we created an animation of a **bouncing ball**! 🏀

## 🎭 Adjustment Layer in After Effects
An **Adjustment Layer** applies effects/changes to **all layers** beneath it, making it a powerful tool for global edits.

### 🔥 Example
🖼️ Adding a **blur effect** to an **Adjustment Layer** will blur all video layers below it.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🎨 You can **create a mask** on an adjustment layer.
- 🔄 Any layers **below** the adjustment layer inherit its **effects or modifications**.
- 🛠️ Any **shape** can be turned into an **Adjustment Layer**.

## 🎮 Null Object in After Effects
A **Null Object** is an **invisible** object that can hold effects and animations **without appearing in the final preview**.

### ❓ How to Add a Null Object?
📍 Just like adding a **solid color layer**, you can create a **Null Object** and use it to control other elements efficiently.
