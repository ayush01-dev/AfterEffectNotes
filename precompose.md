## Pre-Compose in After Effects

### What is Pre-Compose?
Pre-Compose is used to combine multiple layers into a new composition. The new composition works as a single layer in our original composition.

### Benefits of Pre-Compose
1. **Single Composition:**
   - Converts multiple layers into a single composition, making it easier to manage.
2. **Reusable Animations:**
   - Enables using animations multiple times without modifying multiple layers, as changes can be made within a single composition.

### How to Use Pre-Compose
1. Select the layers you want to pre-compose.
2. Click on **Layers** â†’ **Pre-Compose** or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + C`.
